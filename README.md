# Step by Step Making of Step
This repository's fundamental goal is to write `step` from scratch. And each day I will be building step gradually.
This repository will contain update of each day (hopefully) and readme files will contain the step by step walkthrough
of the thought process and development decisions along the way.

Hopefully, I will finish this project this time with a successful development process and a very clean and neat programming language
will be produced.

# Development Process
- [Day 1: 22.07.2024](Day1/README.md): Writing an commadn line argument parser.
- [Day 2: 24.07.2024](Day2/README.md): Writing a lexer to lex the given grammar in the Day2 readme.
- [Day 3: 25.07.2024](Day3/README.md): Writin a error managing system.
